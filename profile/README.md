# DAISI - Distribute AI Systems, Inc.
The DAISI system is build for the masses to use existing, available resources for AI Inference, code generation, tool execution, image generation, and more. 
The system should remain open and free to use, based on a simple credit system. Everytime one of your hosts processes a token for someone else, you get a token that you can use in the future.

Apps, Skills, Tools, and Plugins will be made available through a marketplace in the future so that you can extend your Hosts and Private Networks however you choose. These may come at a fee,
which will be used to grow and support future development.
